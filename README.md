Created by Conner Baird, Jacob DuBois, Isabel McClure, and Matthew Toney

Unfortunately if costs money to host this project, but all of the files are here.

To run this locally:
1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Pull the latest master-branch
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `node index.js`
5. Open a browser to `localhost:5000`
*some features may be broken, due to running on localhost and not the internet*
